*   **Use warning language that will capture attention** (dangerous situation, emergency) but that is not overly dramatic.
*   **Highlight probable impacts to individuals who stay**, including lack of water and electricity and the potential duration of those impacts.
*   **Address the urgency for immediate action** by noting when it will no longer be safe to evacuate or for emergency personnel to attempt rescues as the storm gets close.
*   **Stress the benefits that will encourage individuals to evacuate early**, including: avoiding traffic congestion, driving during daylight hours, and having more assurance regarding availability of gasoline along routes.
*   **Provide up-to-date information on evacuation routes, alternatives, and services available**, including availability of gasoline.
*   **Provide as much detailed information as possible on evacuation routes, traffic, shelters and re-entry plans** to reduce the number of evacuation unknowns which can delay decision making.

*   **The warning forecast is specific to their area.**",0.890137741,0.533941269,"Based on the provided context, key elements of an effective evacuation warning message include:

*   **Attention-grabbing, but not overly dramatic language:** Use warning language that captures attention (dangerous situation, emergency) but that is not overly dramatic, which may cause individuals to feel the threat is overblown.
*   **Comparison to prior events:** Compare the potential impact of an upcoming hazard to similar prior events and their consequences.
*   **Urgency for immediate action:** Address the urgency for immediate action by noting when it will no longer be safe to evacuate or for emergency personnel to attempt rescues as the storm gets close.
*   **Easy corroboration:** Provide easy and quick ways for individuals to corroborate information through hyperlinks to other authoritative sources.
*   **Avoid ""voluntary"":** Do not use the term ""voluntary"" with evacuation notifications. If people in specific zones should evacuate, issue mandatory evacuation notifications.
*   **Clear zone identification:** Include time stamps and easy-to-identify zones or geographic boundary identifiers in notifications to help people comply.
*   **Explanation of evacuation decisions:** When issuing evacuation orders, explain the risks that led to the decision to evacuate some zones and why other zones are not evacuating.
*   **Encourage information sharing:** Always encourage individuals to share information with family and friends.
*   **Interactive maps:** Provide links to user-friendly interactive maps to help individuals locate their home and work addresses and know their zone. During the response phase, these maps should help individuals quickly know whether they are in a zone that is or is not under an evacuation order.
*   **Highlight probable impacts:** Highlight probable impacts to individuals who stay, including lack of water and electricity and the potential duration of those impacts.

*   **Comparison to Past Hazards:** Comparing the current hazard to similar past events helps individuals understand the risk.
